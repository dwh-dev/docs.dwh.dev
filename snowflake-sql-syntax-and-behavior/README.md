# Snowflake SQL Syntax and Behavior

[**Dwh.dev**](https://dwh.dev/) team has been dealing with SQL static analysis for a long time, and we know very well that all databases behave differently: unique SQL syntax, object types, and relationships, and peculiar behavior of seemingly obvious things.

Snowflake documentation often describes not all the nuances of a database's behavior, or yet sometimes it simply doesn't match the actual state of affairs.

In this section, we provide examples of special behavior and SQL syntax and show how [**Dwh.dev**](https://dwh.dev) handles these complexities.
