# Snowflake Marketplace (Native App)

#### Overview

DWH.dev is available directly in the [Snowflake Marketplace](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTSZ1Y553M/dwh-dev-inc-dwh-dev-lineage) as a native application.

This allows you to deploy and run DWH.dev _**inside your own Snowflake account**_, without sharing data externally or managing any external infrastructure.

The Marketplace version of DWH.dev performs static SQL analysis and metadata lineage computation directly in your Snowflake environment - leveraging the same security, governance, and role-based access controls you already use.

***

#### Benefits of Marketplace Deployment

* **100% Snowflake-native** - no data leaves your account
* **Instant setup** - no servers or containers to manage
* **Secure** - fully isolated within your Snowflake account without external dependencies
* **Automatic updates** - always the latest version
* **Continuously up-to-date lineage** - DWH.dev refreshes lineage automatically based on schema change tracking
* **Integrated billing** - usage is billed through your existing Snowflake account balance (no separate contracts or credit cards)
