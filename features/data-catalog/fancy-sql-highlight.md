# Fancy SQL Highlight

The static analyzer provides comprehensive information about all objects and columns at any point in an SQL query, making SQL highlighting more convenient and functional.\
\
In detailed object information and the DDL on the Lineage screen, you can observe SQL highlighting in this manner:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Clickable source objects</p></figcaption></figure>

Each object has an icon corresponding to its type and is clickable. Clicking on it will take you to the selected object. We distinguish all types of Snowflake objects - TABLE, VIEW, STAGE, STREAM, FUNCTION, etc.

Additionally, we've created a reference guide for core functions. Hovering over such a function in SQL, you'll see a brief description:

Clicking will expand the details and provide a link to the original documentation.
