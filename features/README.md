# Features

Although [**Dwh.dev**](https://dwh.dev) is focused on data lineage, the product also has additional features that make life easier for users.\
The main screen is divided into three tabs:

* [**Data Catalog**:](data-catalog.md) A search system that simplifies working with lineage.
* [**Lineage**](column-level-lineage.md): A dependency graph. For small projects (up to 500 connections), it is possible to explore the entire database graph on one screen. For large projects, working with data lineage begins with selecting an object for exploration.
* [**Tasks**](task-tree.md): A dependency graph of TASK objects in the database. You can explore the data lineage generated by each isolated DAG.
